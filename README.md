           I'm still trying to figure this out. Wish me luck!

<p> So, I'm trying to <br> figure out if this works like HTML or something? Like I don't understand how you differentiate files? if that makes sense. </p>

<div class="categories" > About Me </div> <div class="categories"> work </div>

<span> how do I </span> <span> do CSS? </span>

</html>
<CSS>
.categories {
            font-weight: bold;
            }
</CSS>
